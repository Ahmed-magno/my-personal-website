 Al-Ittihad matches are played at Jeddah's main stadium King Abdullah Sports City, which is the second-largest stadium in Saudi Arabia, accommodating 62,345 spectators.[1] Al Ittihad has a long-standing rivalry with Al-Hilal, which is referred to as Saudi El Clasico, and is considered the most prominent and most watched annual match(es) in Saudi football.[4]
  It is the oldest sports club still surviving in Saudi Arabia, as the club was founded in 1927.[4] The most successful period in the club history was the 1990s and the 2000s, when the club achieved a large number of titles and achievements domestically, regionally, and even globally culminating in the club securing the 4th place in the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship in Japan.

      <h2>Travel</h2>

      <p>At home, you build your life just the way you like it, so when you travel you're exposed to all these different ways of being and doing. Soon enough, your perspective begins to shift. That unusual dish becomes your favorite new recipe and the local music makes you want to dance. You find new ways of enjoying life that you can incorporate when you return home. Then when you taste that spice, or hear that song, you are transported across the world, even for a moment..</p>
      <p>You never know who's path you will cross when you're traveling, and how similar we all actually are. This is one of the reasons volunteering is so valuable while traveling. When visiting communities more off the beaten path, it's a reminder that we all want to laugh, love, be with family, enjoy good food and listen to soothing music. You may meet someone completely different from you to challenge your viewpoints, and you might meet a new friend you stay in touch with.</p>

      <p>2 Benefits Swimming.</p>
      <p>1.Like other forms of aerobic exercise, swimming can improve your cardiovascular fitness. “Swimming allows the heart to become stronger and the lungs to become more efficient in utilizing oxygen,” says Brian J. Krabak, MD, clinical professor of rehabilitation, orthopedics, and sports medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle and National Team Physician for USA Swimming. 
 Research shows swimming has been linked to improvements in hypertension, blood pressure, and other markers of cardiovascular health.</p>
 <p>2.All exercise can be a mood booster. But a study published in 2003 in the Journal of Psychology found that a single session of swimming improved mood even more than a single session of aerobic dance (similar improvements in mood were linked with yoga and Feldenkrais movement, a body awareness practice, in the population of women studied). “Due to the release of happiness chemicals in the brain, specifically endorphins dopamine and serotonin, regular swimming can reduce stress, lower anxiety, and combat depression,” Radermacher says.
