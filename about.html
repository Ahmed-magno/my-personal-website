      <p>At home, you build your life just the way you like it, so when you travel you're exposed to all these different ways of being and doing. Soon enough, your perspective begins to shift. That unusual dish becomes your favorite new recipe and the local music makes you want to dance. You find new ways of enjoying life that you can incorporate when you return home. Then when you taste that spice, or hear that song, you are transported across the world, even for a moment..</p>
      <p>You never know who's path you will cross when you're traveling, and how similar we all actually are. This is one of the reasons volunteering is so valuable while traveling. When visiting communities more off the beaten path, it's a reminder that we all want to laugh, love, be with family, enjoy good food and listen to soothing music. You may meet someone completely different from you to challenge your viewpoints, and you might meet a new friend you stay in touch with.</p>
